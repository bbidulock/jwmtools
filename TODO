TODO
----
- trayscript if ~/.config/jwmtools/trayscript.sh is not found, show missing script path instead of empty label

Wishlist
--------
- tray applet with frequently used applications (next to launchers)
- something for simple CD/DVD clonning
- system menu (parameter for appmenugen to show only system categories or something)
- calendar (there is some component in glade, should be easy enough), current "cal -3 | gmessage -file -" is not very usefull
- proper "turn off dialog" (also with reboot, logout, etc..), currently gmessage (and poweroff if confirmed)
